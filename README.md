## About

AfterHours is a private modpack created for the AfterHours minecraft server.
AfterHours is a white-listed modded minecraft server similar to FTB or Tekkit.
The aim for the modpack from the beginning has been to add a combination of
industrialization and magic to minecraft without compromising the difficultly
of vanilla minecraft. Some of the major differences between this and other
modpacks are the following:
* All overpowered mod aspects removed!
* Custom Recipes for balancing of the multi-mod system!
* Mods added for a more vanilla feel to modded minecraft (steeper progression)!
* LOTS of cosmetic/aesthetic based mods!
* Massive changes to the hunger system!

## Mod List
